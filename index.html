<h2>INTRODUCTION:</h2>
<p>Gulliver’s Travels, original title Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World, four-part satirical work by Anglo-Irish author Jonathan Swift, published anonymously in 1726 as Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World. A keystone of English literature, it is one of the books that contributed to the emergence of the novel as a literary form in English. A parody of the then popular travel narrative, Gulliver’s Travels combines adventure with savage satire, mocking English customs and the politics of the day.</p>
<h3>Part I: <br><ins><i>A Voyage to Lilliput:</i></ins></h3>
<p><mark>In 4 May 1699 – 13 April 1702</p></mark>
<ul>
    <li>Mural depicting Gulliver surrounded by citizens of Lilliput.</li>
    <li>The travel begins with a short preamble in which Lemuel Gulliver gives a brief outline of his life and history before his voyages.</li>    
    <li>During his first voyage, Gulliver is washed ashore after a shipwreck and finds himself a prisoner of a race of tiny people, less than 6 inches (15 cm) tall, who are inhabitants of the island country of Lilliput.</li>
    <li> After giving assurances of his good behaviour, he is given a residence in Lilliput and becomes a favourite of the Lilliput Royal Court.</li>
    <li>He is also given permission by the King of Lilliput to go around the city on condition that he must not hurt their subjects.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Part II:<br><ins><i>A Voyage to Brobdingnag:</i></ins></h3>
<p><mark>20 June 1702 – 3 June 1706</mark></p>
<ul>
    <li>Gulliver soon sets out again. When the sailing ship Adventure is blown off course by storms and forced to sail for land in search of fresh water</li>
    <li>Gulliver is abandoned by his companions and left on a peninsula on the western coast of the North American continent.</li>
    <li>The grass of Brobdingnag is as tall as a tree. He is then found by a farmer who is about 72 ft (22 m) tall, judging from Gulliver estimating the man's step being 10 yards (9 m). </li>
    <li> The giant farmer brings Gulliver home, and his daughter Glumdalclitch cares for Gulliver. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Part III:<br><ins><i>A Voyage to Laputa, Balnibarbi, Luggnagg, Glubbdubdrib and Japan:</i></ins></h3>
<p><mark>5 August 1706 – 16 April 1710</mark></p>
<ul> 
    <li>Setting out again, Gulliver's ship is attacked by pirates, and he is marooned close to a desolate rocky island near India.</li>
    <li>He is rescued by the flying island of Laputa, a kingdom devoted to the arts of music, mathematics, and astronomy but unable to use them for practical ends</li>
    <li>Rather than using armies, Laputa has a custom of throwing rocks down at rebellious cities on the ground.</li>
    <li>Gulliver tours Balnibarbi, the kingdom ruled from Laputa, as the guest of a low-ranking courtier</li>
</ul>
<h3>SUMMARY:</h3>
<p>In the first one, Gulliver is the only survivor of a shipwreck, and he swims to Lilliput, where he is tied up by people who are less than 6 inches (15 cm) tall. He is then taken to the capital city and eventually released. The Lilliputians' small size mirrors their small-mindedness.</p>
